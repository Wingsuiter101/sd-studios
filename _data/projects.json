Designed for football coaches, players, and analysts, Tiki Data provides a comprehensive suite of tools to simulate, visualize, and strategize various game scenarios.The app allows users to draw tactical plays with precision, using tools specifically created for passes, runs, and zone marking. Coaches can visually define team shapes and measure key metrics like team width and depth to better understand tactical formations.\nHeatmaps are integrated to analyze player positioning and movement trends, providing insights that were previously challenging to achieve.One of the standout features of Tiki Data is its ability to offer multiple predefined formations, such as 4-3-3 or 3-5-2, while also allowing users to create custom formations tailored to their team's style of play. All formations can be saved and revisited, streamlining the process of creating a library of tactical ideas.\nThe app also includes an animation timeline feature, enabling coaches to simulate match scenarios in a dynamic and visual manner. This feature is particularly beneficial for breaking down complex movements and strategies into digestible segments, making it easier for players to comprehend their roles on the field.\n\nTo ensure ease of use, the app's interface was designed with clarity and simplicity in mind. Despite its technical capabilities, the app remains highly intuitive, allowing users to focus on tactical creativity rather than being bogged down by complex workflows. Tiki Data combines powerful functionality with a sleek and minimalist design, making it a must-have tool for anyone involved in football strategy.\nBuilt using Vite and React, Tiki Data leverages a modern development stack for speed and efficiency. Tailwind CSS ensures a cohesive and customizable design system. ESLint integration maintains code quality and consistency. This technology stack ensures that Tiki Data remains scalable, maintainable, and performant, providing a seamless experience for end users.\nFrom planning training sessions to preparing for crucial matches, Tiki Data is the ultimate assistant for enhancing tactical awareness and execution."
